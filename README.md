## 🚀 Microservices Docker Project

This project demonstrates a simple microservices architecture using **Docker Compose**. It includes three services:
- 🍭 `product-service`
- 📍 `order-service`
- 👤 `user-service`

Each service runs as an isolated container, built from lightweight Python (Flask) images.

## 🗂️Each Microservice:
```
- ✅ Is a small standalone Python (Flask) application.
- ✅ Has its own Dockerfile to containerize it.
- ✅ Has its own requirements.txt to install dependencies.
- ✅ Returns a simple response like "User Service is running!" when accessed via a browser or API call.

```
All services are managed and run together using a docker-compose.yml, which:
```
- ✅ Builds images from the respective folders.
- ✅ Starts all services in one go.
- ✅ Exposes each service on its respective port.

```

## ⚙️ Setting Up Docker-in-Docker (DinD)
```
To build and run containers **from inside another container**, we used **Docker-in-Docker** (DinD) setup with `--privileged` mode and Docker socket mounting.
```
1. **Created a Docker image with Docker + Git preinstalled:**
   ```dockerfile
   FROM docker:dind
   RUN apk add --no-cache git bash
   ```

2. **Built the DinD image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t ubuntu-dind-dev .
   ```

3. **Ran a container from this image with Docker socket sharing:**
   ```bash
   docker run -it --privileged \
     -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
     -v $(pwd):/workspace \
     -w /workspace \
     --name docker-dev-container \
     ubuntu-dind-dev
   ```
```
This enabled the container to **run Docker commands as if on the host system**.
```

## ⚙️ What we can do with this setup:
```

- ✅ Learn and practice Flask microservices architecture
- ✅ Learn Docker & Docker Compose in a real-world setup
- ✅ Understand service isolation, containerization, and port mapping Extend each service to have its own:
- ✅ Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- ✅ API endpoints (CRUD operations)
- ✅ Internal communication (via REST APIs or gRPC)

```
## 📌 Highlights
```

- ✅ Docker-in-Docker for flexible development.
- ✅ Modular microservices structure.
- ✅ Easy-to-scale containerized architecture.
- ✅ Clean CI/CD-ready setup.

```
## 🚀 Future Enhancements
```

- ✅ Add API endpoints to perform real operations like add users/products/orders.
- ✅ Connect microservices using REST calls between services.
- ✅ Add databases per service (e.g., user-db, product-db).
- ✅ Add frontend UI to consume all APIs.
- ✅ Implement service discovery, authentication, or message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ/Kafka).
- ✅ Deploy this architecture to the cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure).
