## 🚀 Microservices Docker Project

This project demonstrates a simple microservices architecture using **Docker Compose**. It includes three services:
- 🍭 `product-service`
- 📍 `order-service`
- 👤 `user-service`

Each service runs as an isolated container, built from lightweight Python (Flask) images.

```
## Each microservice:
```
- ✅ Is a small standalone Python (Flask) application.
- ✅ Has its own Dockerfile to containerize it.
- ✅ Has its own requirements.txt to install dependencies.
- ✅ Returns a simple response like "User Service is running!" when accessed via a browser or API call.

```
All services are managed and run together using a docker-compose.yml, which:
```
Builds images from the respective folders.
Starts all services in one go.
Exposes each service on its respective port.

```
## 🏗 Architecture Overview (Microservices Pattern)

        ┌────────────┐       ┌────────────────┐
        │  Browser / │─────▶│  User Service   │ (http://localhost:5001)
        │  API Tool  │─────▶│ Product Service │ (http://localhost:5002)

```
## ⚙️ What You Can Do with This Setup:
```
Learn and practice Flask microservices architecture
Learn Docker & Docker Compose in a real-world setup
Understand service isolation, containerization, and port mapping
Extend each service to have its own:
Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
API endpoints (CRUD operations)
Internal communication (via REST APIs or gRPC)

```
## ⚙️ Setting Up Docker-in-Docker (DinD)
```

To build and run containers **from inside another container**, we used **Docker-in-Docker** (DinD) setup with `--privileged` mode and Docker socket mounting.

```
##✅ Steps followed:

1. **Created a Docker image with Docker + Git preinstalled:**
   ```dockerfile
   FROM docker:dind
   RUN apk add --no-cache git bash
   ```

2. **Built the DinD image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t ubuntu-dind-dev .
   ```

3. **Ran a container from this image with Docker socket sharing:**
   ```bash
   docker run -it --privileged \
     -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
     -v $(pwd):/workspace \
     -w /workspace \
     --name docker-dev-container \
     ubuntu-dind-dev
   ```

This enabled the container to **run Docker commands as if on the host system**.

## 📌 Highlights
```

- ✅ Docker-in-Docker for flexible development.
- ✅ Modular microservices structure.
- ✅ Easy-to-scale containerized architecture.
- ✅ Clean CI/CD-ready setup.

```
## 🚀 Future Enhancements You Can Try:
```

Add API endpoints to perform real operations like add users/products/orders.
Connect microservices using REST calls between services.
Add databases per service (e.g., user-db, product-db).
Add frontend UI to consume all APIs.
Implement service discovery, authentication, or message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ/Kafka).
Deploy this architecture to the cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure).
